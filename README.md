# @Admission-Enquiry-System
This is a normal simulator of Admission Enquiry in a particular University.
This is based on File Handling. I simply simulate DU data as per my need. 
By this i get a program that totally depends upon files.

## Advantages
1. It is a generic code that can apply on particular files.
2. Database can be updated easily without changing any line of code. 
3. Follow a particular manner of updating.

## Disadvantages
1. It depends on files. 
2. Very less secure & reliable
3. Database may be corrupt.

### Need of creation
I just want to create a code that has no updates & bugs.
That can be used easily & easy to update database by user.
